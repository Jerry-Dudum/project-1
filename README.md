## Summary
This application allows the user to play a matching number game with a computer generated random number. The user chooses from four poisons with different values only seen once it is clicked and the corresponding number is displayed. If the user matches the computer's chosen random number then their win will be tallied. Just as if the user doesn't match the computer generated number then a loss will be tallied.

'''JQuery

  var foodArray = ["chinese", "mexican", "burger", "sandwich", "pizza", "thai", "sushi", "korean", "chicken wings", "ramen", "hawaiian", "mediterranean", "arabic", "indian", "soul food"];

$(document).on("click", "#random", yelpInfo);

function yelpInfo() {

    jQuery.ajaxPrefilter(function (options) {
        if (options.crossDomain && jQuery.support.cors) {
            options.url = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/' + options.url;
        }
    });

    var randomFood = foodArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * foodArray.length)];
    console.log(randomFood);

    var yelpAPIkey = "szilVGiGWvqemg5iRsO467vT0806iGe5kazKMT1iONvN4XqA4fzTGbKMtpuIudFVSiRB7ikZ_ZWvI0Xr0ImMpuCdS_sMsejPHdti0ml3Wj_4TiirKzYxKZ7rWeB7XXYx"

    $("#yelp-info").empty();

    var queryURL = "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=" + randomFood + "&limit=4&latitude=" + currentLocation.lat + "&longitude=" + currentLocation.lng

    $.ajax({
        url: queryURL,
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            authorization: "Bearer " + yelpAPIkey
        }
