## Summary

Our application also has the option to customize the search through the type of food, price range, and the amount of restaurants displayed below on our Google API powered map.

## Code Snippet
`````Javascript

  var foodArray = ["chinese", "mexican", "burger", "sandwich", "pizza", "thai", "sushi", "korean", "chicken wings", "ramen", "hawaiian", "mediterranean", "arabic", "indian", "soul food"];

$(document).on("click", "#random", yelpInfo);

function yelpInfo() {

    jQuery.ajaxPrefilter(function (options) {
        if (options.crossDomain && jQuery.support.cors) {
            options.url = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/' + options.url;
        }
    });

    var randomFood = foodArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * foodArray.length)];
    console.log(randomFood);

    var yelpAPIkey = "szilVGiGWvqemg5iRsO467vT0806iGe5kazKMT1iONvN4XqA4fzTGbKMtpuIudFVSiRB7ikZ_ZWvI0Xr0ImMpuCdS_sMsejPHdti0ml3Wj_4TiirKzYxKZ7rWeB7XXYx"

    $("#yelp-info").empty();

    var queryURL = "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=" + randomFood + "&limit=4&latitude=" + currentLocation.lat + "&longitude=" + currentLocation.lng

    $.ajax({
        url: queryURL,
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            authorization: "Bearer " + yelpAPIkey
        }
